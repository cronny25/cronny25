# Senior Full Stack Engineer | Cloud-Native Systems | Scalable Architecture

Senior Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience designing and delivering high-performance distributed systems across FinTech, Healthcare, Insurance, and SaaS platforms.

I specialize in backend architecture (Go, Python, Node.js), cloud-native systems (AWS), and production-grade frontend applications (React, Next.js, TypeScript).

---

## 🚀 What I Focus On

- Designing scalable microservices architectures
- Building event-driven systems with high reliability
- Cloud-native development on AWS
- CI/CD & Infrastructure as Code
- Secure, compliant systems (SOC2, HIPAA)
- Performance optimization & observability

---

## 🏗️ Architecture-Driven Engineering

I build systems with:

- Clean Architecture principles
- Domain-driven design
- API-first development (REST & GraphQL)
- Event-driven pipelines (Kafka, SQS, Lambda)
- Infrastructure automation (Docker, ECS, Kubernetes)
- Blue/Green & zero-downtime deployments

## 💡 Highlighted Projects

### 🔹 Distributed Quoting Engine (Go + Node + React)
High-availability service processing high-volume requests with retry strategies, idempotency keys, and caching layers.

- Microservices architecture
- Redis-based rate limiting
- Circuit breaker pattern
- 99.9% reliability design

---

### 🔹 Event-Driven Document Processing Pipeline
AWS Lambda + Step Functions workflow automating asynchronous document generation.

- S3 triggers
- Step Functions orchestration
- Retry & dead-letter queue strategy
- Structured logging & tracing

---

### 🔹 Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture
Full-stack SaaS boilerplate demonstrating:

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- OAuth2 + PKCE
- Tenant isolation strategies
- PostgreSQL indexing & performance tuning
- Dockerized local dev environment

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Backend
Go (Gin), Python (FastAPI, Django), Node.js (NestJS, Express)

### Frontend
React, Next.js, Vue, TypeScript, Redux, React Query

### Cloud & DevOps
AWS (Lambda, ECS, RDS, S3), Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, CI/CD

### Data
PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Snowflake, Kafka

## 📈 Engineering Principles

- Systems over features
- Reliability over hype
- Observability by default
- Secure-by-design
- Performance is a feature
- Code is a liability unless well-tested
